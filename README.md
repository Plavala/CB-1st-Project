# CB-1st-Project
First project in the coding boot camp.
## Description
This is our first group project! We have been tasked to use our newly acquired skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and web APIâ€™s to build a web application from scratch. With our team we will conceive and execute a design that solves real-world problems by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. We will write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help our team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project as a means to track the status of your project tasks will help us understand the benefits of Kanban boards.
Because we will be working collaboratively, we will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

Project Title: FindMyCrypto

Project Description: This application displays cryptocurrency data and allows a user to put in a budget for a crypto purchase to see what they can acquire within their budget.

*Here is an example of what that page looks like.*

![*This page includes a navigation bar, a header image, and info box's such as about crypto and examples*](assets\images\Screenshot 2022-04-14 190728.png)


User Story: As a user, I want to find out about various cryptocurrencies, so that I can acquire coins and tokens that fit my budget and criteria. 

Acceptance Criteria:
```
When I go the home page 
Then I see a constant stream of the top ten crypto trading prices

When I scroll down 
Then I see news articles related to crypto

When I look to the side of the crypto feed
Then I see current crypto market prices

When I look to the side of the page
Then I see the FindMyCrypto calculator 

When I click find my crypto
Then I am taken to a modal to enter info to find crypto

When I click I scroll to the bottom and click contact
Then I see a form to enter contact information
```

APIs: CoinBase, CoinGecko, NewsData.io
